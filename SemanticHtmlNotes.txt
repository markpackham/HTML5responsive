Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
<header>, <nav> , <main> and <footer> create the basic structure of the webpage.
<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
<article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
<aside> contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
<figure> encapsulates all types of media.
<figcaption> is used to describe the media in <figure>.
<video>, <embed>, and <audio> elements are used for media files.


<header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing <h1> to <h6> headings.
<header>
  <h1>
     Everything you need to know about pizza!
  </h1>
</header>



Main and Footer
Two more structural elements are <main> and <footer>. 
These elements along with <nav> and <header> help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.

The element <main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the <footer> 
and the <nav> of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. 
By using <main> as opposed to a <div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that 
whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

<main>
  <header>
    <h1>Types of Sports<h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h3>Baseball</h3>
    <p>
      The first game of baseball was played in Cooperstown, New York in the summer of 1839.
    </p>
  </article>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>Email me at Codey@Codecademy.com</p>
</footer>




<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. 
For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single <section>. 
A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.
<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2> 
</section>


<article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. <article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. 
An <article> tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, 
images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.
<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
  <article>
    <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 15 days.</p>
  </article>
</section>



The <aside> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order 
to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside other elements such as <article> or <section>. 
Some common uses of the <aside> element are for:
Bibliographies
Endnotes
Comments
Pull quotes
Editorial sidebars
Additional information
<article>
  <p>The first World Series was played between Pittsburgh and Boston in 1903 and was a nine-game series.</p>
</article>
<aside>
  <p>
   Babe Ruth once stated, “Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.” 
  </p>
</aside>



<figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg"/>
</figure>


<figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the <figure> tag. Usually, <figcaption> will go inside <figure>.
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg">
  <figcaption>This picture shows characters from Overwatch.</figcaption>
</figure>



<audio> element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like <video>, <audio> uses src to link the audio source.
<audio>
  <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

Autoplay & show controls for audio - playback, volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.
<audio autoplay controls>

Other attributes for audio

<video> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.
<video src="coding.mp4" controls>Video not supported</video>
The “Video not supported” will only show up if the browser is unable to display the video.
Like audio, video has a lot of attributes

Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the <embed> tag, 
which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. This means that websites 
that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. 
The <embed> tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the <video> element.
<embed src="download.gif"/>
